 With the growth of e-commerce websites,
people and financial companies rely on online services to carry out
their transactions that have led to an exponential increase in the
credit card frauds
1. Fraudulent credit card transactions lead to a loss of huge amount
of money. The design of an effective fraud detection system is
necessary in order to reduce the losses incurred by the customers
and financial companies
2. Research has been done on many models and methods to
prevent and detect credit card frauds. Some credit card fraud
transaction datasets contain the problem of imbalance in datasets.
A good fraud detection system should be able to identify the fraud
transaction accurately and should make the detection possible in
real-time transactions.
